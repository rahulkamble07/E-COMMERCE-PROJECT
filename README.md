# E-COMMERCE-PROJECT

Overview
This project is a web application developed using Java Spring Boot with Spring MVC for the backend, and React.js for the frontend. It utilizes MySQL as the database management system, and employs HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling. The application exposes RESTful APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

                      Features:- 
# Backend:
Spring Boot: Provides the framework for building the backend services.

Spring MVC: Manages web requests and responses, implements MVC architecture.

MySQL: Relational database management system for storing application data.

REST API: Endpoints for CRUD operations.


#  Frontend:
React.js: JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
